            <p>I wrote this blog post about a year ago but finally got a chance to publish it.</p>
<p>How many <code>::</code>’s does it take to screw in a light-bulb? A <code>car</code>’s worth.</p>
<p>I’m currently in a class where we are using Scheme extensively. This has made me very used to the idea of structuring my algorithms using <code>car</code> and <code>cdr</code> for any sort of data manipulation.</p>
<p><code>car</code> returns the head of a List while <code>cdr</code> returns the tail of List.</p>
<p>Here is a simple implementation of a sum function to understand how <code>car</code> and <code>cdr</code> works.</p>
<pre><code>(define (sum some-list)
    (if (null? some-list) 0
        (+ (car some-list) (sum (cdr some-list)))
    )
)
</code></pre>
<p>This is a structurally recursive approach in which we add the first element of each recursive step up until we have no more elements in the list, in which case we return a concrete 0.</p>
<p>Having been doing Scheme for about 4 months, this is a very common pattern I see. It’s the construct that allows for the general idea of “iterating through a list” to function.</p>
<p>What I wanted to do was compare this with another functional language, Scala, and see what the differences were.</p>
<p>Scala is the best language I have ever written in. (Not true anymore :D, now it's Go) I have been using it for about a year and a half now and absolutely love it. Since both of the languages are considered functional, they share many similarities. However, I feel like Scala has many more abstractions that make things a lot easier.</p>
<p>To mirror the above code, here is the same idea applied in Scala.</p>
<pre><code>def sum(someList: List[Int]): Int = {
    someList match {
      case Nil =&gt; 0
      case x :: xs =&gt; x + sum(xs)
    }
}
</code></pre>
<p>There is a very clear distinction between these two. Scala uses a concept known as pattern matching to get the head and tail of a List whereas Scheme uses predefined functions to do the same thing. What is interesting, though, is how both of these concepts are trying to do the same two things — wrangle with the structure of lists.</p>
