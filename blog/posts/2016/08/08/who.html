            <p>I went to an art workshop last week. It was hosted by an Austrian artist couple who call themselves UBERMORGEN. If I never knew anything about them, or if I never heard of their art, I would think that they were hackers making cool side projects for fun. I would never view them as artists. Look at their projects and tell me they wouldn’t win 1st place at any hackathon with those ideas.</p>
<p>I went to an event I couldn’t get into because of my age and sat outside on the sofas. I started talking to a man sitting next to me. It turned out he was an incredibly successful entrepreneur turned entrepreneur/vc. We talked for an hour before another event started.</p>
<p>The incredibly strange thing to me is that I identified more with the work of those artists than I did with the entrepreneur.</p>
<p>I just wanted to write about this because it’s been on my mind since I left that workshop.</p>
